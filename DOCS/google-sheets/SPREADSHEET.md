Data sources in the spreadsheet are refreshed within a time interval. You can specify the start time by clicking the Scheduled Refresh button in the Sheets editor, but the interval is fixed at 4 hours. For example, if you specify a start time of 8 AM , the refresh will take place between 8 AM and 12 PM every day.

## Interval

Represents a time interval, encoded as a Timestamp start (inclusive) and a Timestamp end (exclusive).

The start must be less than or equal to the end. When the start equals the end, the interval is empty (matches no time). When both start and end are unspecified, the interval matches any time.
